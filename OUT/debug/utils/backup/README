This is a safe copy of your previous kernel before flashing this AntaresCore debug version.

If you have issues with the new kernel flash this zip file in recovery mode to revert to the previous kernel.

Do not forget to report the issue to AntaresOne (http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=5464206) so that he can fix it. :)
